### 提案目的
- 增加SHARE锁仓量并提高SHARE的流动性
- 当前SHARE的流动性主要由SHARE/USDT SHARE/HUSD SHARE/wHT和SHARE/pNEO四个池子提供，总体深度为约60万美元；当前日产SHARE数量为43.74枚
- 为了进一步提升SHARE的流动性和交易深度，提议拿出5000枚SHARE用于额外奖励为SHARE/USDT提供流动性或者质押SHARE的用户。

### 执行方案：
- 5000枚SHARE分100天线性释放，每天50枚SHARE
- 额外建立SHARE-USDT-LP池，用于该部分奖励发放
- 用户可以质押SHARE-USDT-LP来获取SHARE收益。

### Proposal purpose
- Increase the amount of SHARE lock-up and improve the liquidity of SHARE. 
- The current liquidity of SHARE is mainly provided by the four (4) pools: SHARE/USDT, SHARE/HUSD, SHARE/wHT and SHARE/pNEO, with a total depth of about 600,000 U.S. dollars. Daily output of SHARE is 43.74.
- In order to further enhance the liquidity and transaction depth of SHARE, it is proposed to use 5000 SHARE as additional rewards for users who provide liquidity for SHARE/USDT or pledge SHARE.

### Action plan
- 5000 SHAREs are released for 100 days. 
- 50 SHAREs per day is for providing additional liquidity in SHARE-USDT-LP pool or pledge SHARE to obtain SHARE rewards.
