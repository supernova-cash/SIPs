SIP_007_SHARESWAP_ADJUSTMENT.md
### 提案目的
- HT价格和NEO的价格飙涨，导致sHT/HT和sNEO/pNEO的TWAP被动下水从而引起SHARE增发。因此建议提高弹性稳定币增发SHARE回购相关资产的阈值并降低数量。提高SHARE抵抗价格波动的能力。

### 优化方案：
- 除sCASH星球外，其余星球的ShareSwap触发条件由TWAP低于0.95调整为0.85，且释放SHARE数量为该星球已释放SHARE数量的1%。

### Proposal purpose
- The price of HT and NEO skyrocketed, leading to the passive launch of TWAP of sHT/HT and sNEO/pNEO, which led to additional issuance of SHARE. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the threshold of the flexible stable currency to issue additional SHARE repurchase related assets and reduce the quantity. Improve SHARE's ability to resist price fluctuations.

### Optimization
- Except for the sCASH planet, the ShareSwap trigger condition of other planets is adjusted from TWAP lower than 0.95 to 0.85, and the number of SHARE released is 1% of the number of SHARE released by the planet.
